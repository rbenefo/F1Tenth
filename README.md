# F1Tenth Labs

A few projects I did in ROS while preparing for my independent study in mLab at Penn.

Included are several algorithms that implement control and planning for the [F1Tenth](https://f1tenth.org/) vehicle in ROS, using the F1Tenth simulator:

* A reactive gap planner, which implements the Follow The Gap algorithm for simple obstacle avoidance. Below is a youtube link of the output:

* A pure pursuit planner, which implements the pure pursuit algorithm for trajectory following. Below is a youtube link of the output:

* A wall following controller.

* A safety node that activates emergency braking if a crash is imminent.
